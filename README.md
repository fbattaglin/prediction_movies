The dataset contains information about movies in Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB. Both are considered review-aggregation websites for films. 
On IMDb, all films are given an overall rating out of ten. In a roundabout way, these ratings are derived from votes submitted by IMDb users, not movie critics.
Rotten Tomatoes gives films a score out of 100 based on the averaged reviews of professional film critics.The website also separately ranks film by user scores, but let’s not get distracted by that here.

### Metodology and Sampling
There are 651 randomly sampled movies produced and released before 2016. There are 32 available variables.  Note that the sample size is very small, compared with the population of movie watchers as a whole, which also does not allow us to draw conclusions. This is an observational study therefore we cannot establish causality.

##### Some Possible Sources of Bias
- The data is collected from movie fans, therefore may not represent the average movie goer. It is possibe these can be sources of **sampling bias**.
- The study sampling is random, however, so the results are generalizable to movies produced and released before 2016 in the US. However, it will not be generalizable to all movies released in **all parts of the world**.

## Part 2: Research question

Should you watch a movie? Well, there are a lot of factors to consider, such as the director, the actors, and the movie’s budget. Some of us base our decision off of a review, a short trailer, genre, or just by checking the critics rating.
